Adds Sublime Merge commands to VSCode/VSCodium.

To differentiate between other Sublime Merge plugins, this one isn't concerned with what workspace (multi or single) you have setup.

Whatever file you have open, it will traverse up the directory structure and find the appropriate `.git` repository.

## Features

- View File History
- View Line History
- Blame File

All commands are available in the Command Palette and Context Menus for the Explorer and Editor.

## Installation

```sh
ext install adhamu.history-in-sublime-merge
```

## Requirements
Ensure the `smerge` command is in your `$PATH`.
